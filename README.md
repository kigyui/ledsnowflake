Magical Latex Girl LED Snowflake necklace

[See construction details here](https://www.kigyui.com/ledsnowflake)

Designed a snowflake using OpenSCAD (snow.scad) and converted it to a STL
file (snow.stl) for 3d printing.  Used a white filament with .3mm layer height
and 1.2mm walls.

Wrote the arduino code to do a flicker effect using the two PWM pins
(ledsnowflake.ino) and programmed onto a ATTINY85 using an [arduino
ISP](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829)

Used a strip of cool white led lights taken from a big set bought cheap from ebay.
